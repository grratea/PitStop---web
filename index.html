        <h3>Wolff reveals message he sent to Hamilton after seeing former Mercedes man at Ferrari for first time</h3>

            Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has revealed that he messaged Lewis Hamilton shortly after seeing the first photographs of his former driver at Ferrari, praising the seven-time World Champion for an “iconic” look.
            Hamilton linked up with Ferrari last week to start an intensive programme of pre-season preparations covering factory tours, staff introductions, simulator work and on-track running in previous machinery.
            On his first day, Hamilton posted an update to his social media channels that included an image of him posing outside Ferrari team buildings in an all-black suit and alongside an F40 sports car.
            It marks the first change of teams for Hamilton since 2013, when he joined Mercedes from McLaren – the Briton going on to win six drivers’ titles and contribute to eight constructors’ titles at the Silver Arrows.
            Speaking to Sky Sports F1 at this week’s Autosport Awards in London, Wolff gave his reaction to Hamilton’s Ferrari arrival and how he is processing the situation.
            “It’s a little bit like you divorce amicably and it’s all good, then you see your [ex-]partner for the first time with a new friend!” Wolff smiled.

            Following the news that LVMH has joined Formula 1 as a Global Partner for 10 years from 2025, the sport is welcoming Louis Vuitton as an Official Partner of Formula 1.
            Bringing together two of the world’s most recognisable brands, known for their innovation and excellence, Louis Vuitton will become the title partner for the first race of the season in Melbourne – the Formula 1 Louis Vuitton Australian Grand Prix 2025.
            The French House will be immersed in F1 weekends, including prominent trackside signage – a first for Louis Vuitton at a sporting event. They will also have a key role in celebratory moments such as the opening ceremony and on the podium, where their famous Louis Vuitton Trophy Trunks will be presented to celebrate the top three drivers’ achievements.
            The new Trophy Trunks, covered by the emblematic monogram, will be emblazoned with the iconic “V” in a unique local colour scheme for each race against the classic brown background.

        <h3>Norris reveals biggest lesson he's learned in 2024 and why it’s made him ‘excited’ for next season</h3>
        <br>
        <img src="images/2173723984.avif" alt="Article Three">

            Lando Norris has explained that the biggest learning he took from his 2024 season was the knowledge that he has “what it takes” following his battle against Max Verstappen for the world championship, with the Briton admitting that he has gained confidence in himself after not always feeling this way in the past.
            When asked if he fancies his chances from a championship perspective in 2025 given the confidence he has gained in the season gone by, Norris answered: “Of course. I fancied it already this year, but it was just a little too late.
            “I definitely have had things to improve on and to look back on and try [to] correct and to improve. Nevertheless, I think the thing I’ve learned and I’ve gained the most this year is confidence in myself.
            “Sounds very simple, [but] I’ve just always been quite the opposite kind of guy, and I always find [that] I need to go out to prove it to myself before I want to start believing anything. This year, yeah I made some mistakes and I didn’t give a good enough fight to Max, but it was a good effort, and the one thing I’ve learned from [it is that] I have what it takes.
