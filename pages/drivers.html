                    Max Verstappen has long been locked in at Red Bull, 
                    with the world champion’s deal running through to the 
                    end of 2028. This has not prevented speculation over a 
                    possible move elsewhere, amid rumours of interest from 
                    Mercedes. Verstappen has stated, however, that he is not
                    considering changing teams.

                    One of the biggest driver market moves of recent times 
                    happened before the 2024 season had even started when 
                    it was confirmed that Lewis Hamilton would make the shock 
                    switch to Ferrari in 2025, bringing his long partnership 
                    with Mercedes to an end.

                    The other spot at Ferrari will be retained by Charles 
                    Leclerc. Having raced for the Scuderia since 2019, the 
                    Monegasque has pledged his future to the squad, having 
                    signed a contract extension which will see him stay

                    As they continue their progression following a rapid 
                    surge in performance during 2023, McLaren have settled
                    on their driver line-up for the long-term. Lando Norris
                    – who has been racing for the team since making his F1
                    debut in 2019 – agreed a new “extended multi-year”
                     contract with the squad prior to the start of 2024.
